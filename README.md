virtualcurrencys trading alerts
==============================

A simple alert system for when volume on a Bitcoin Exchange hits a certain number in a specified timeframe. When volume hits a certain threshold, you can be alerted in two ways: through an audio file being played or via e-mail. Hopefully you'll hear it, in the inevitable middle of the night, wake up, and profit (or panic).

## Alerts

Currently, the tool is capable of playing an audio file alert and sending an e-mail alert. The default action of the tool is to rate-limit the alert to once every five minutes, regardless of volume after the initial alert. This can be changed with the `--limit` command. Setting the limit to zero (`--limit 0`) will continually play an alert for the whole period of above-specified volume.

### E-Mail Alert

Example e-mail alert with 5-minute volume on Mt. Gox hits 500BTC:

    ./trade_alert.py gox 300 500 e-mail --host mydomain.org --port 587
        --recipient me@mydomain.org --sender me@mydomain.org

SSL, TLS, and plain SMTP (no encryption) is supported with the `--encryption` option. Also pay attention to the `--limit` option. It's currently set to 300 seconds, but you may want to set it higher so you don't nuke your inbox.

### Audio Alert

Example of an audio alert for 500BTC volume in last 5 mins:

`./trade_alert.py gox 300 500 audio --audiofile ./notify.wav`

_Alert Suggestion:_ ["Damn we're smooth" -Beavis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjRRgAYWnUA)

Audio is played using command line tools. You can specify a specific player with the `--player` command. For example, if you want to play an audio file using `/usr/bin/parole`, you should use `--player /usr/bin/parole`. You can also specify command line arguments. The audio file will be tacked onto the end of the specified command as an argument. You can also let the tool search for a suitable player automatically. Currently tools are tried in the following order:

- Linux
    1. aplay
    2. /dev/dsp
    3. vlc
- Windows
    1. vlc
- OSX
    1. vlc

I'll also accept pull requests for more players/platforms.
